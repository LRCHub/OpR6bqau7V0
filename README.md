```lrc
[00:00.04] I can do this, somehow I know it
[00:04.36] I'll get Heaven behind my plans (Charlie, hold on)
[00:08.66] There's just no way I could blow it
[00:12.64] Not this once in а lifetime chance (it's just a meeting)
[00:16.81] To change their minds and touch their hearts
[00:20.36] Or whatever angels have (this could be bad)
[00:23.91] Cheer up, Vaggy, this could be swell
[00:27.47] Something tells me that today will be a happy day in hell
[00:55.97] 
[00:32.13] Okay, but just don't sing to them (that bitch is halfway down the street)
[00:35.38] Is she? (Oh, she's dancin')
[00:37.01] Ugh, no
[00:40.51] 
[00:38.04] There's a warm, fuzzy feelin' that wafts through the air
[00:41.52] Every street so revealing, it's hard not to stare
[00:44.71] It's a realm so appealing, it beats anywhere
[00:48.46] If you don't mind the smell
[00:51.66] It's a happy day in hell
[00:54.85] Hi, mister! (Go fuck yourself!)
[01:10.35] 
[00:56.91] There's an endless trash fire that's burning my soul (hello)
[01:00.37] Got a ton of barbed wire to shove in his hole (oh, excuse me)
[01:03.72] Doin' what is required, we all have our role
[01:07.49] I'm not doin' well
[01:10.33] Another shitty day in hell
[01:23.33] 
[01:13.52] If I can show them the dream I've dreamed
[01:17.47] That any soul can change ('cause angels minds are hard to change)
[01:20.19] Then they will know everyone can be redeemed
[01:24.00] From the evil to the strange (they're bloodthirsty and deranged)
[01:56.00] 
[01:29.31] I can hear all their stories, the lost and displaced
[01:33.72] And I know that they're more of an acquired taste
[01:37.72] But if I open the door and I give them a place
[01:41.10] At my Hazbin Hotel
[01:44.09] It'll be a happy day in hell
[01:58.09] 
[01:51.66] From the porn studio, where the cinephiles go
[01:54.56] To watch award-winning demon bukkake shows
[01:57.44] To the cannibal town, where they don't wear a frown
[02:00.01] 'Cause, holy shit, oh my gosh, why?
[02:03.67] And I don't give a crow that his brain's got in my eye
[02:09.41] 'Cause I know I can spare them from heaven's genocide
[02:35.91] 
[02:14.72] I can do this, I just know it (there's an endless trash fire that's burning my soul)
[02:17.95] I'll get Heaven (ah-ah) behind my plans
[02:21.04] There's just no way I could blow it (kinda like the barbed wire that's shoved in my hole)
[02:24.42] Not this once (ah-ah) in а lifetime chance to change their minds (and touch my parts!)
[02:31.16] Uh, no, thank you, I'm just gonna fulfill my destiny (your loss, bitch)
[02:38.18] I can already tell
[02:40.83] Today is gonna be a fuckin' happy day in hell
